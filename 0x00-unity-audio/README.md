# 0x00 Unity Audio

**Audio Sources, Audio Listeners, Audio Mixers, and controlling audio elements with scripts**


## General Learning Objectives

* What is an Audio Source

Contrary to what this project states, this will not be the final version of my platformer.
It is not in a state that I would consider even close to finished, there are a lot of bugs
glitches, and strange behaviour I need to work out before it is complete.
